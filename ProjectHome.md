Fairly self explanatory to be honest. iaxscan is a Python based scanner for detecting live IAX/2 hosts and then enumerating (by bruteforce) users on those hosts. It does so, in an obvious fashion, by sending valid IAX/2 requests and monitoring responses. Being UDP based it has all the advantages and disadvantages of the medium, so watch out for that. At the moment there is no password cracking functionality as there are other tools that do that quite nicely but if you really feel the need for it then create a ticket.
